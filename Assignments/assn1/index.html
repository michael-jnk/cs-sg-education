            <p>
                Hello there! I am <span class="name">Michael Jenkins</span>, a student at UNC Chapel Hill. I am a
                Computer Science major, and a member of the Chancellor's Science Scholar's
                cohort 11. I enjoy programming, reading, going on hikes, and playing video games.
                I've been interested in computers since a young age, and have dabbled in a few
                different areas of computer science and engineering; like soldering, 3d printing,
                game development, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm learning basic web development, both on my own and as a part of
                UNC's Computer Science + Social Good Education Team. I am learning basic HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript, and in the near future I'll be learning React. I also have some
                personal projects I am working on, to be published sometime in the future!
